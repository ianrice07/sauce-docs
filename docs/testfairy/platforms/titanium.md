The TiTestFairy Module extends the Appcelerator Titanium Mobile framework, with the TestFairy Android and iOS SDKs. The TestFairy SDK enables integration with TestFairy to give you a better understanding of how your app performs on real devices. It tells you when and how people are using your app, and provides you with any metric you may need to optimize your user experience and code.

## Installation

1. Add the following lines to your `tiapp.xml` file:

   ```xml
   <modules>
       <module platform="iphone">com.testfairy.titestfairy</module>
   </modules>
   ```

1. Download the [latest release.](https://github.com/testfairy/ti.testfairy/releases/latest/)

   - Be sure to either download either the Android (com.testfairy.titestfairy-android-2.1.3.zip) or the iOS (com.testfairy.titestfairy-iphone-2.1.3.zip) depending on the platform you're targeting.

1. Add the module to your Titanium Mobiles

   - “Help” -> "Install Mobile Module..."
   - or by unzipping the contents of the module zip file into your `Titanium/modules/iphone` or `Titanium/modules/android` folders.

1. Include the module in your code and use it:

   ```javascript
       var TiTestFairy = require('com.testfairy.titestfairy');
       TiTestFairy.begin("<APP TOKEN>");
   ```
